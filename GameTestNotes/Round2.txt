* Go into elevator, go to floor 4, leave elevator, go to the right once, go back, go into elevator, arrow on the right goes to the captain, only first time
* arrows are still hard to click/easy to miss
* o1: arrow hard to see among lights

* might want to consider a quest tracker, I forgot what to do after talking to the technician

* get the crowbar, talk to someone, click the crowbar mid sentence, hit next, talk to them again, the dialogue disappears after a second
* "paper tucked into the wall", "the board was pulled", "pulling it out without a tool" "get into things that don't want to open up" These sentences don't exactly paint a clear picture of what I'm looking at especially since I just break the board off anyway

* b1 is available immediately after speaking to the captain
* infinite note glitch still possible if I talk to Penelope again
* crowbar is available again
* inventory does not place multiple objects in individual spots (everything was in 1 slot)
* stuck at bad omen
