Looking at mirror - Still got the same dead look in my eyes. It'd be nice if I left that back in Eastwyn.

Looking at the newspaper - Enough of that self-serving crap. Ain't helping my mood.

Bed - Middle class comfort? Maybe, but it's too gaudy for my tastes.

Luggage - Delayed indefinitely and only about four days worth of luggage. Just my luck.

---HALL

Room Number - Numbers with no real meaning. Besides telling me where I'm supposed to sleep, there's nothing else to figure out.

Carpet - Maybe the ship stopped cuz the crew’s just sittin’ somewhere, mesmerized by these godawful carpet patterns.

Elegant elevator doors - Real pretty design. Hope it works better than the rest of this ship.

Wrong floor - Locked out. Looks like some floors are off-limits. Maybe they don't like the creaturefolk mixing with the elites.
